## Inventory-Manager

**Java Project**

In this prohect, I was given the task of creating an inventory manager.  I had a special attachment to this project because it dealt with parts mangagement which was something I was deeply familiar with from my previous career.  I found this project to be chanllenging and honestly, fun for me to work on. I built a custom list of parts and products, then built a GUI for the the information to be displayed on.  By adding, removing, or modifying parts the user could creat there own product that would display varios information.

**Given Scenario**

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

You have been provided with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached “Software 1 GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be considered for the application. A systems analyst created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section of this task based on the business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
