## Inventory-Manager

**Java Project**

In this project, I was given the task of creating an inventory manager using JavaFX.  I had a special attachment to this project because it dealt with parts mangagement which was something I was deeply familiar with from my previous career.  I found this project to be chanllenging and honestly, fun for me to work on. I built a custom list of parts and products, then built a GUI for the the information to be displayed on.  By adding, removing, or modifying parts the user could create there own product that would display various information.

**Given Scenario:**

"You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program."
